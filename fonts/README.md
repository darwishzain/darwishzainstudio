Install a font manually by downloading the appropriate .ttf or otf files and placing them into /usr/local/share/fonts (system-wide), ~/.local/share/fonts (user-specific) or ~/.fonts (user-specific). These files should have the permission 644 (-rw-r--r--), otherwise they may not be usable.

Run fc-cache to update the font cache (add -v for verbose output). The above mentioned paths can be customized in the fontconfig configuration file at /etc/fonts/fonts.conf â€“ you can also include subdirectories or links, which is useful if you have a directory of fonts on a separate hard drive (or partition or other location).
